## ðŸ“š Class Notes

Of my three courses I would say NLP had the most painful introduction
ritual. Characterized as a "speed dating" like exercise, we stood up,
walked around the room and introduced ourselves to our classmates, and
each time she rang the bell we had to shuffle about and begin again. While
terrifying, upon reflection I believe an exercise of this nature is probably
worthwhile. One thing that became quite evident to me is the need to craft
a sort of elevator pitch about myself. This is something I want to put some
thought into. How can I convince others that I am kind, useful, and interesting?
That seems like a good place to start.

After introductions, Juniper did the typical housekeeping and then got right into
it. The part of the lecture that really got my wheels turning was her discussion
on the challenges of NLP. 

### Key NLP Challenges:

- **Syntactic Ambiguity**
  - *Example:* Knife crime: St John Ambulance to teach teens to help stab victims (actual headline)
  
- **Word Sense Ambiguity**
  - *Example:* "bank" (financial institution vs. river bank)
  
- **Non-Standard Language Forms**
  - *Example:* Think emojis and octothorpes mixed with creative and colorful language. YAS QUEEN!
  
- **Segmentation Issues**
  - *Example:* "New York" vs. "New" + "York"
  
- **Idioms**
  - *Example:* "kick the bucket", "break a leg"
  
- **Neologisms - often specific to their place in time**
  - *Example:* "pause: 2020s", "bae: 2010s", "dig: 1950s"
  
- **Internal Knowledge (Domain Specific)**
  - *Example:* My kid's name is Ira. 
  
- **Entity Names**
  - *Example:* "Apple" (company vs. fruit), "Paris" (city vs. person)
  
- **Formatting**
  - *Example:* File type, punctuation, spacing variations

And what's truly amazing about all of this to me is not so much that we can instruct computers
on how to handle these challenges. What I find remarkable is how our human minds do this
all day every day. We effortlessly process spoken and written language and all of its context
constantly and instantly. In this moment where all anyone can talk about is artificial intelligence
I think it's worth pondering the beauty of what is between our own ears.

## ðŸ“– Thoughts on Borges' The Library of Babel for Thursday's Class

I know this work was published in 1941, but I couldn't stop drawing comparisons to the current
moment. While I am not at all certain this was the intention, it felt prescient to me. The library
conjured for me the internet. Both seem to contain a nearly endless (but not quite) landscape of 
information filled with wisdom and gibberish. One thing I found interesting about the library is 
that there seemed to be no framework for validation - no scientific method, no experimentation, only
random strings that may or may not come together to convey some kind of idea. This is where it 
significantly differs from the internet. However, we have all the same issues despite all of our
tools for validating information and critical thinking skills. Another comparison one could make, if 
so inclined, is that we may become somewhat like those in the library in that through recommendation 
algorithms we tend to not stray too far from our home hexagon.

I suppose I should think about this in the context of NLP as well. It seems logical to connect
the challenges mentioned in my class notes above. If you imagine the library as the training corpus, you
would have to make sense of repeating nonsense like M C V, endless noise and contradiction. Maybe the
idea is that language in all its glory will always lead to issues of context and ambiguity.
