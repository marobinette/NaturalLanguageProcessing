OVERVIEW
The Electrical Engineering (EE) program at the University of
Vermont is at the forefront of research in the areas of digital
signal processing, control systems, power and energy systems,
wireless communications, and electronic circuit and system
design and testing. This rigorous and focused program offers
competitive funding and prepares graduate students for careers
in research and technical leadership. Graduate students can
contribute to interdisciplinary research within a broad range of
applications, including power/energy, biomedical, aerospace, and
transportation. In addition, the EE program partners with other
academic units to offer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science
and a Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering.

Computer Engineering Courses
CMPE 5220: Advanced Computer Architecture. 3 Credits. Provides a thorough and sophisticated examination of various
hardware aspects of modem computers, including: virtual memory,
instruction-set architectures, instruction-level parallelism through
pipelining, caches and cache coherence, threads, vector processors,
and GPUs. Prerequisites: Familiarity with topics of computer
organization as would come from the equivalent of CS 2210 or
CMPE 2210; Graduate student. Credit not awarded for both
CMPE 5220 and CS 3220 or CMPE 3220: Cross-listed with:
CS 5220: CMPE 5410: Digital VLSI Circuit Design. 0 or 3 Credits. Covers the techniques for the design, analysis and layout of digital
CMOS circuits and systems. Major topics include MOSFET
basics (structure and behavior of a MOSFET, CMOS fabrication,
and design rules), detailed analysis of the CMOS circuits and
systems (static behavior, ratioed vs. ratioless design), noise margins,
computing rise and fall times, delay models, resistance. Prerequisite:
Electrical Engineering Graduate student, Computer Science
Graduate student, or Instructor permission. Cross-listed with:
EE 5410: CMPE 5540: Real-Time Control Systems. 3 Credits. Digital control systems analysis and design. Topics include: difference
equations, the Z-transforms, discrete-time transfer functions, state-
space models, sampled-data systems, discretization, real-time control,
microprocessor implementation, and optimal control. Project-
based final. Prerequisite: Electrical Engineering Graduate student,
Computer Science Graduate student, or Instructor permission.
Cross-listed with: EE 5540: CMPE 5610: Information Theory. 3 Credits. Introduction to probability concepts of information theory; entropy
of probability models; theoretical derivations of channel capacity;
coding methods and theorems, sampling theorems. Prerequisite:
Graduate student or Instructor permission. Cross-listed with:
EE 5610, CS 5610: CMPE 5810: Digital Computer Design. 3 Credits. To gain a solid understanding of digital computer operating
mechanisms and reconfigurable computing, and advance into hands-
on experiences to design and debug digital computer system and
embedded system. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) will
be utilized as the development platform. Prerequisite: Electrical
Engineering Graduate student, Computer Science Graduate student,
or Instructor permission. Cross-listed with: EE 5810, CS 5810: CMPE 5990: Special Topics. 1-18 Credits. See Schedule of Courses for specific titles.
CMPE 5991: Intemship. 1-18 Credits. On-site supervised work experience combined with a structured
academic leaming plan directed by a faculty member or a faculty-staff
team in which a faculty member is the instructor of record, for which
academic credit is awarded. Offered at department discretion.
